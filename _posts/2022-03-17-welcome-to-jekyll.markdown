Welcome to the site. This is just a prototype ,just a testing process. It's a personal site for sharing ideas with the world. 

This Blog site is generated by Jekyll site developer. Gems are used to shorten the code dependencies. The site domain is from `github` . 


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Manik')
#=> prints 'Hi, Manik' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
